# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Module 7

## Overview of the Analysis:

The Pewlett Hackard is a large organization that has thousands of employees. The large population of these employees are babyboomers and is about to retire. To ensure there are proper hiring and transfer of knowledge processes in place, the company  executives requested to get the following tables created in the database: 

* The Number of Reiring Employees by Title
* The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program


## Results:

Using PgAdmin and SQL queries I was able to create the multiple tables that were needed to complete the strategic analysis and plan for retirement of babyboomers at the Pewlett Hackard. Below is a sample query for reference.

The major points from this analysis are: 

      * The employee data for the company is not well organized and will need more work
      * The initial count of employees eligible for retirement is very high
      * The number of retirement eligible employees fluctuate by depratment
      * The number of retirement eligible employees fluctuate by title


## Summary:

The tables that were created answer two major questions: which department or positions would be the most vulnerable to the retirement wave and where HR and talent acquisition teams should focus their attention. 

It would be a good idea to conduct a salary analysis and compare it to the base salary of newly highered emplyees. It will help further guide the executive team with their strategic planning for the future of the company.
